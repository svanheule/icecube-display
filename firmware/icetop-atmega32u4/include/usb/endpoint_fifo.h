  * \brief USB endpoint FIFO access.
  * \details A `memcpy`-like interface is provided to read from, and write to, the USB endpoint
  *   FIFOs.
  *
  *   USB communication happens asynchronously to microcontroller operation. Any data
  *   transferred to one of the device's USB endpoints is stored in the memory buffer
  *   associated with this endpoint.
  *   Since this endpoint memory is separated from the rest of the microcontroller's RAM,
  *   this memory has to be read out via a special register acting as a FIFO buffer.
  *   Before reading from or writing to an endpoint's FIFO, the endpoint needs to be
  *   selected. See \ref usb_endpoint_stack for more information.
  *
  *   ~~~{.c}
  *   // Read all bytes currently stored in the FIFO
  *   uint8_t buffer[64];
  *   fifo_read(&buffer[0], fifo_byte_count());
  *
  *   // Write a buffer to the endpoint FIFO
  *   uint8_t buffer[] = {...};
  *   fifo_write(&buffer[0], sizeof(buffer));
