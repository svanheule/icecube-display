# Verifying display controller interface functionality

In order to test if the python scripts function as expected without the need of
having actual controllers handy, a number of `VirtualController`s can be used.

By declaring/setting the environment variable `VIRTUAL_DEVICES`,
DisplayController.findAll() will return a list of virtual devices. These
objects implement the same interface as regular DisplayController objects, but
only exist in memory.
Optionally, display frames that are written to these virtual devices can be
stored in a directory that is specified by the `DEBUG_FRAME_PATH` environment
variable.
