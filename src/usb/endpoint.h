  * \brief Configuration of USB endpoint hardware and memory.
  * \details Endpoint configuration is currently only focussed on control endpoints, so provisions
  *   for other endpoint types are rather minimal.
  *   For the default control endpoint (EP 0) the following config could be used:
  *   ~~~{.c}
  *   static const struct ep_hw_config_t EP_0 = {
  *       // Endpoint number 0
  *       0,
  *       // ... is a control endpoint
  *       EP_TYPE_CONTROL,
  *       // ... with a single 64B bank, the maximum allowed by USB 2.0 for a full-speed device.
  *       EP_BANK_SIZE_64 | EP_BANK_COUNT_1
  *   };
  *   ~~~

  * \defgroup usb_endpoint USB endpoint operations
  * \details All communications on the USB bus happen between the host and a device endpoint.
  *   A number of functions is provided to facilitate endpoint manipulation on the microcontroller.
  *   Since the ATmega32U4 microcontroller only allows access to one endpoint at a time, an
  *   \ref usb_endpoint_stack "endpoint selection system" is provided.

// Endpoint selection stack

/** \defgroup usb_endpoint_stack Endpoint selection
  * \ingroup usb_endpoint
  * \brief Selection of the currently active endpoint.
  * \details On the ATmega32U4 only one USB endpoint can be accessed at a time.
  *   This is done by writing the endpoint number to the `UENUM` special function register.
  *   When using interrupts, it may happen that an operation on one endpoint is interrupted to
  *   perform an operation on another endpoint. In this case, the original endpoint number
  *   should be stored before selecting the new endpoint, and restored after the operation on the
  *   new endpoint is finished.
  *
  *   An endpoint stack is provided to simplify this bookkeeping. Endpoint selection is done via
  *   a call to endpoint_push() and automatically stores the previously selected endpoint.
  *   When the endpoint can be released again, endpoint_pop() should be called to ensure the
  *   previous endpoint is restored.
  *   ::EP_STACK_DEPTH determines how many endpoint operations can be performed simultaneously
  *   using the endpoint stack.
  *
  *   ~~~{.c}
  *   // Select endpoint 0 by pushing it to the top of the stack.
  *   endpoint_push(0);
  *
  *   // Read 64 bytes from endpoint 0
  *   uint8_t buffer[64];
  *   fifo_read(&(buffer[0]), 64);
