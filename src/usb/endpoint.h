  * \brief Configuration of USB endpoint hardware and memory.
  * \details Endpoint configuration is currently only focussed on control endpoints, so provisions
  *   for other endpoint types are rather minimal.
  *   For the default control endpoint (EP 0) the following config could be used:
  *   ~~~{.c}
  *   static const struct ep_hw_config_t EP_0 = {
  *       // Endpoint number 0
  *       0,
  *       // ... is a control endpoint
  *       EP_TYPE_CONTROL,
  *       // ... with a single 64B bank, the maximum allowed by USB 2.0 for a full-speed device.
  *       EP_BANK_SIZE_64 | EP_BANK_COUNT_1
  *   };
  *   ~~~

  * \defgroup usb_endpoint USB endpoint operations
  * \details All communications on the USB bus happen between the host and a device endpoint.
  *   A number of functions is provided to facilitate endpoint manipulation on the microcontroller.
  *   Since the ATmega32U4 microcontroller only allows access to one endpoint at a time, an
  *   \ref usb_endpoint_stack "endpoint selection system" is provided.
