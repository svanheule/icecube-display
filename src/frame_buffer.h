  * \defgroup led_display LED display usage
  * \brief APA102 LED display implementation and usage.
  * \details The LED display consists of a number (::LED_COUNT) of APA102 modules connected in
  *   series. A frame buffer therefore contains 4Ã—78 bytes of display data, plus one byte of flags.
  *   A pool of memory with room for multiple frames is pre-allocated and calling create_frame()
  *   will mark one the available frame buffers as used and return a pointer to it. This pointer
  *   can then be used to draw new frame contents, push it into the frame queue for display and
  *   release the memory with destroy_frame() when it is no longer of use.
  *
  *   A frame buffer has room for ::LED_COUNT ::led_t objects. The order of these objects
  *   corresponds to the IceTop station number, so frame_buffer_t::buffer[0] contains the data for
  *   station 1, frame_buffer_t::buffer[1] for station 2, etc.
  *   The contents of the frame are not written to the LED display in-order, but in alternating
  *   directions per row of stations, with the array oriented such that stations 1-7 form the
  *   bottom row.
  *   Due to the way the data lines of the LEDs are connected stations 7 to 1 are written first in
  *   decreasing order, then 8 to 13 in increasing order, etc.
  *
  *   Two flags are currently supported as defined by ::frame_flag_t. A newly allocated frame will
  *   not have any of these set, so the user should take care of setting these as needed to prevent
  *   any memory leaks or corruption. After drawing a frame with its ::FRAME_FREE_AFTER_DRAW flag
  *   set, the memory will be released. Using this pointer after the frame has been released, may
  *   result in memory corruption, so take care not to used dangling pointers!
  *   In the current implementation, frame memory is not dynamically allocated and will eventually
  *   be used to draw other frame contents. If two renderers were to render to the same memory
  *   region, the frame may contain contents of both renderers. Since the memory is not used by
  *   any other code however, using invalid pointers will most likely not crash the code, but only
  *   result in odd things being displayed. The same odd-behaviour-warning applies to a frame whose
  *   ::FRAME_DRAW_IN_PROGRESS flag is set. Since a frame buffer is pushed to the LED string
  *   out-of-order, weird tearing effects may occur.
